    <div class="infoabout">

        <br>
        <br>
        As an act of philanthropy, more and more people from all across the world are getting interested in volunteering
        for the underprivileged ones, and are traveling across the borders to stretch their helping hands. Volunteering
        abroad, along with the concept of ‘socially impactful journey’ has evolved much in the 21st Century, and people
        are extremely keen about focusing on societal development and personal growth while exploring a new destination.
        <br>
        <br>
        Volunteering Solutions was established in 2006 with the aim of changing the face of volunteer travel, and in the
        last 17+ years, we have had more than 21,000 volunteers who completed their journeys with life-changing
        experiences. Nicknamed as VolSol, we provide the best volunteer and intern opportunities to interested
        candidates from different parts of the world, and we ensure that each of them gets the maximum out of the
        program they choose.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, Volunteering Solutions operates in more than 26 countries, providing more than 150 volunteering and
        interning options ranging from Child Care, Teaching, Medical and Healthcare, Community Development, Marine
        Conservation and much more. Most of our volunteers are high school students, couples, corporate groups and
        individuals on their summer break or gap year.
        <br>
        <br>
        We are in collaboration with NGOs, schools, hospitals, orphanages, HIV/AIDS clinics, women groups and other
        social welfare organizations all across the globe. Each of these organizations has been working at the
        grass-root level for years, and successfully contributed towards the development of the concerned people. VolSol
        has ensured that the contribution of every volunteer is counted, and there’s sustainable growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the internship programs, participants opting for Medical and Healthcare projects get to work with
        professionals and learn how to deal in emergency situations. Our internship programs are crafted and designed in
        a way that every participant gets to know about the medical scenario of a particular country. It is both an
        inward and outward journey - inward, as you’ll get to learn a lot through the first-hand experience, and
        outward, as the society will be benefitted by your contribution.
        <br>
        <br>
        As an organization, we have a cross-cultural set up in all our offices across the world. We have people from
        different countries, cultures, and ethnicities working for us in order to make the process of volunteer
        traveling smoother and more flexible.
        <br>
        <br>
        We have dedicated coordinators at each volunteer destination, coming from different countries. We take care of
        the volunteer’s placement, traveling, accommodation, meals, and security.
        <br>
        <br>
        To say it in short - “Volunteering Solutions is the best way to volunteer, intern and travel across the world.”
